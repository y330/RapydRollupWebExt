# RapydWebpackExt

**Actually, this is using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/), not webpack.**

This experimental extension is a calendar extension, and it demonstrates compiling python(`.pyj` files) to Javascript, then using the [rollup plugin chrome extension](https://github.com/extend-chrome/rollup-plugin-chrome-extension/) package from NPM to build the extension files for live reloading in the browser. 

This is a webextension made using rapydscript, a python to js translator. Want to find out more? go to [RapydScript Github repo](https://github.com/atsepkov/RapydScript/)
